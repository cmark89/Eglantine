--The navmesh system loads the .lua file into a system of 
Polygons and Links.

--Next, the system should build a list of nodes that will be used
by pathfinding.  

NavNode
	Point position;
	List<NavNode> links;
	List<Polygon> parentpolygons;

	LinkToNode() -- Links this point with the given node
	LinkToNodes() -- Links this point with all nodes provided
	LinkToPolygon() -- Iterate over all nodes and link to each one
		           that has given polygon as a parent
	
For each polygon...
	-Create a NavNode for each vertex
	-Ensure the NavNode "belongs" to the target polygon
	-Create a NavNode for the center of the polygon
	
For each link...
	-Add each point as a navnode that belongs to both polygons
	-If there is already a node at this coordinate, remove it and
	replace it with the link instead of creating redundant points
	
The...
	-Iterate over each node and link it with its enclosing polygon.
	-Do this:
	
	foreach NavNode in nodes
		foreach Polygon p in parentPolygons
			LinkToPolygon(p)
		



When clicking to move...
	-First, find out what polygon the player clicked in.
	-Add a new node at that position and LinkToPolygon(clickedPolygon)
	-Add a new node at the player's position and LinkToPolygon(playerstandinginpolygon)
	-Find a path between the two temporary points.  
	-Once the list of waypoints has been found, remove the 
	temporary points.
